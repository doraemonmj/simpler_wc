/**
 * CommContext — device-side distributed communication context.
 *
 * This struct is the ABI contract between host (comm_hccl.cpp / comm_sim.cpp)
 * and device kernels. PTO communication instructions (TREDUCE, TGET, TPUT)
 * access remote data through the GVA addresses in windowsIn[]/windowsOut[]
 * via MTE2 DMA.
 *
 * Host fills the struct from scratch:
 *   - comm_hccl.cpp (Path D): allocates a per-rank symmetric pool via the
 *     public ACL IPC primitives (aclrtMalloc + aclrtIpcMemGetExportKey +
 *     SetImportPid + ImportByKey), then writes rankId / rankNum / winSize /
 *     windowsIn[]. No HCCL-private struct is reinterpret_cast'd here; the
 *     layout is owned end-to-end by simpler.
 *   - comm_sim.cpp: same shape, filled with malloc'd host pointers.
 *
 * The leading layout through windowsOut is shared with pto-isa's parallel
 * HcclDeviceContext declaration. Simpler-owned transport fields are appended
 * after that compatible prefix.

// The struct itself lives in this repo, so on the surface these asserts look

// is that this layout is consumed by *two* out-of-band parties that never see
// this header at the same time:
//
//   1. The pto-isa repo carries a parallel declaration (HcclDeviceContext)
//      that must be prefix-compatible with this struct -- pto-isa kernels read
//      windowsIn[]/winSize/rankId via that mirror. Any insert/reorder before
//      the simpler-owned tail that is not matched in pto-isa silently shifts
//      the device-side field offsets and corrupts MTE2 reads. The locks below
//      pin our side; pto-isa should add its own mirror asserts.
//
//   2. Device kernels (AICore / AICPU) compiled with CCEC may apply slightly
//      different alignment rules than host gcc. A host-side sizeof/offset
//      lock is a necessary-but-not-sufficient guard.
//
// Treat the numbers below as a tripwire: changing them is a deliberate act
// that forces the editor to coordinate the matching change on the pto-isa
// side, not a routine "oh I just added a field" edit.
